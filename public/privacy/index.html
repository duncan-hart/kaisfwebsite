<h4 id="notification-of-changes-to-the-privacy-policy">Notification of changes to the Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time.  Please visit this website section periodically in order to keep up to date with the changes in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-we-collect-your-information">How do we collect your information?</h4>
<p>We may collect information about you directly whenever you interact with us. For example, when you contact KAiSF regarding our activities,send or receive information, you may provide us with your personal information.</p>
<h4 id="what-information-do-we-collect">What information do we collect?</h4>
<p>The information we collect from you directly or from third parties with whom we work, may include:</p>
<pre><code>name,
address,
email address,
telephone number,
contact preferences,
bank account details,
date of birth or age,
</code></pre>
<p>We do not use cookies to collect this type of information. All online financial transactions will be encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security).</p>
<p>We may also collect and process information about your interactions with us, including details about our contact with you through email, SMS, post, on the phone or in person (i.e., the date, time, and method of contact), any other support you provide to us.  We may also collect and record any other relevant information you share with us about yourself, including your interests or your affiliations with other charities, community groups, your employer or a KAiSF partner. If you are a minor, we may collect the name and contact details of a parent or guardian and, where appropriate, the name and location of your school.</p>
<h4 id="do-we-process-sensitive-personal-information">Do we process ‘sensitive’ personal information?</h4>
<p>Under data protection law, certain categories of personal information are recognised as sensitive, including health information and information regarding race, religious beliefs, and political opinions (‘sensitive personal data’).  In limited cases, we may collect sensitive personal data about you. We would only collect sensitive personal data if there is a clear reason for doing so, such as where we need this information to ensure that we provide appropriate facilities or support.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-we-use-your-information">How do we use your information?</h4>
<p>We may use your information in a number of ways, including:</p>
<pre><code>To provide you with information that you have requested from us or that we feel may be of interest to you;
To provide you with information about our work or our activities;
For administrative purposes (for example, we may contact you regarding a grant application you have submitted, to provide information requested from us through a supporter or with a query regarding a grant application you may have made to us);
For internal record keeping relating to any grant applications or grants awarded;
To invite you to participate in voluntary surveys or research;
To contact you where you have been identified as a contact person for an organisation, such as a school (if we obtain your contact details in this way, we will only use them to contact you in your capacity as a representative of that organisation unless you have separately indicated that you are happy to be contacted as an individual supporter);
To analyse and improve the content and operation of our website;
To analyse and improve our internal business processes;
To assess your personal information for the purposes of grant application risk reduction or fraud prevention; and
Where we are required by law to disclose or otherwise use your information.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="how-will-we-disclose-the-information-we-have-collected-to-outside-parties">How will we disclose the information we have collected to outside parties?</h4>
<p>We will never sell your details. We will only share your details with third parties (who are not service providers working at our direction) as indicated in this Policy or if you have consented or we have another legal basis to do so.  We will not make cold telephone calls to members of the general public for individual support and, therefore, will not purchase your data in order to do so.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information if we are requested or required to do so by a regulator or law enforcement or in order to enforce or apply our rights (including in relation to our website or other applicable terms and conditions) or to protect KAiSF, for example in cases of suspected fraud or defamation, or in order to comply with any other applicable legal obligation.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-we-protect-your-personal-information">How do we protect your personal information?</h4>
<p>We take appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your information secure, accurate and up to date, and that we only keep it as long as is reasonable and necessary.</p>
<p>Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal information, the transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure. We do our best to protect personal information, but we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to our website, so any transmission is at the user’s own risk.</p>
<h4 id="how-long-do-we-keep-your-personal-information">How long do we keep your personal information?</h4>
<p>We will keep and delete your information according to our internal policies and will keep it no longer than reasonably necessary for the purposes for which we hold it, taking into account relevant legal and regulatory retention requirements (e.g. tax or health and safety requirements) and operational considerations.</p>
<h4 id="what-other-data-protection-rights-do-you-have">What other data protection rights do you have?</h4>
<p>Under UK data protection law, you have certain rights over personal information that we hold about you. These rights are summarised below. Please note that exceptions apply to a number of these rights, and not all rights will be applicable in all circumstances.</p>
<p>You can assert your rights, raise a concern, or make a complaint about how we process your personal data by contacting us. It will assist us, if you explain your request or concern and describe the personal information you are referencing as specifically as possible. In order to action your request, we may need to request further information or request that you provide proof of identity.</p>
<p>Your rights in relation to our processing of your personal information, include:</p>
<pre><code>Right to object to the processing of your data - you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.  If you object, please explain your objection and the reason for it.  If you are objecting to the processing of your data for direct marketing purposes, you can tell us in any of the ways described in the section ‘How can you change your marketing preferences or update the information we hold about you?’ above and we will stop processing your data for those purposes as soon as reasonably possible.
Right to have inaccurate or incomplete personal information corrected or completed - if you believe our records of your personal information are inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to correct or complete those records. You can do this as described in this section or in the section ‘How can you change your marketing preferences or update the information we hold about you?’ above.
Right to restrict processing – in certain circumstances, you have the right to ask us to stop making active use of the personal information that we retain in our records about you, if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage.   
Right of erasure - in certain circumstances, you have the right to request that we delete your personal information from our records.
Right of access - you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what information we hold relating to you and to request a copy of that information. Provided we are satisfied that you are entitled to see the information requested and we have successfully confirmed your identity, we will provide you with your personal information subject to any exceptions that apply.
Right to receive your personal information in a portable format – in limited circumstances, where we are processing information you provided to us because you gave us your consent or because it is necessary for the performance of a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means, you may ask us to provide it to you in a portable format.
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not happy with how we have handled your request or complaint, you can contact the Office of the Information Commissioner, which oversees the protection of personal data in the UK.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may choose to contact the Information Commissioner directly about your complaint, regardless of whether you have raised it with us first.</p>
<h4 id="why-are-we-allowed-to-process-your-personal-information">Why are we allowed to process your personal information?</h4>
<p>Our Privacy Policy takes into account several laws, including:</p>
<pre><code>the Data Protection Act 2018
the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003
General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679
</code></pre>
<p>Generally, our processing of your personal information as described in this policy is allowed by these laws based on one or more lawful grounds, including:</p>
<pre><code>Where you have provided your consent to us using your personal information in a certain way.  For example, we only use your information to send you marketing communications by email or text with your consent.  We also may ask for your explicit consent if you share sensitive personal information with us.
Where the processing is reasonably necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract.  For example, we may rely on this basis where you apply to work for us.
Where the processing is reasonably necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject.  For example, we may rely on this basis where we are obliged to share your personal information with a regulator or HMRC.
Where the processing is reasonably necessary for the purpose of a legitimate interest pursued by us or a third party and your privacy rights do not override the legitimate interest.  Our “legitimate interests” include pursuing the aims and ideals of KAiSF.  However, &quot;legitimate interests&quot; can also include your interests, such as when you have requested information from us, and those of third parties, such as our beneficiaries.
</code></pre>
<p>In any event, where we are relying on legitimate interests to process your personal information, we will consider any potential impact on you (positive or negative), your rights under data protection laws, and will not use your personal information for activities where the impact on you overrides the legitimate interests in the processing.</p>
<p>Where we process sensitive personal data (as mentioned above), we will make sure that we only do so in accordance with one of the additional lawful grounds for processing that type of data, such as where we have your explicit consent or you have made that information manifestly public.</p>
<h3 id="emails-terms-of-use">Emails terms of use</h3>
<p>Emails aren’t always secure, and they may be intercepted or changed after they’ve been sent. KAiSF doesn’t accept liability if this happens. The contents of emails reflect their author&rsquo;s views and not necessarily those of KAiSF.</p>
<p>Please do not send KAiSF any financial data through email.</p>
<p>The information in emails is confidential, so if you’ve received one by mistake, please delete it without copying, using, or telling anyone about its contents.</p>
