### A New Mobility Scooter

"I am writing to thank you for the Â£1000 cheque towards the mobility scooter, which I recevied yesterday. My scooter is arriving on Friday. Your kindness will give me back my independence and enable me to get out more. I want to thank you all, without the scooter I would be very limited to what I can do."

Mr D, Kidderminster.

### A New Bath 

"Thank you for the money for myself and my children, which will be a big help for having a new bath, so that my disabled son can use it safely."

The K family, Kidderminster.

### A New Bed & Washing Machine

"My son sustained severe head injuries in a road traffic accident. After a long period of rehabilitation he was able to return home. We needed some financial support to purchase household items for him, and applied to KAiSF for a grant to buy a bed and washing machine. We were very grateful to receive money from KAiSF to make these purchases. It made all the difference."
   
Mr P, Kidderminster.
